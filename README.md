# Predict-Bike-Sharing-Demand-with-AutoGluon

## 📌 Project Idea

This project is part of the Machine Learning Fundamentals Nanodegree program from Udacity.

The project uses the **AutoGluon** library (an open-source AutoML toolkit developed by Amazon that automates machine learning tasks for tabular, text, and image data) to train and optimize models for predicting bike sharing demand, based on the Kaggle Bike Sharing Demand competition dataset. This helps businesses like Uber and Lyft anticipate demand spikes and improve customer experience.

What is AutoGluon?
AutoGluon is an open-source framework developed by Amazon that enables easy and fast training of machine learning models. It automatically tries multiple algorithms and selects the best model.


## 🎯 Objectives
- Train and optimize multiple ML models using AutoGluon.  
- Produce a detailed report summarizing the project and results.

## 📋 Project Steps

1. **Project Setup**  
   Prepare the environment and load data.

2. **Complete the Jupyter Notebook**  
   Use AutoGluon’s Tabular Prediction module to train and evaluate several models, optimizing for the best accuracy.

3. **Complete the  Report**  
   Summarize findings, model performances, and insights.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python  
- AutoGluon  
- Pandas, NumPy
